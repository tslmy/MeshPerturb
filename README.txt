1. Before running these files make sure that:
(a) COMSOL LiveLink for MATLAB is running
(b) The 'MATLAB libraries' folder and all of its subfolders are added to the MATLAB path list.

2. If unfamiliar with codes, suggested order:
(a) Processing individual studies -> 2D models, 3D models
(b) Unattended parametric analysis -> 1D parametric study
(c) Unattended parametric analysis ->Evaluating smallest weight for bifurcation 
(d) Unattended parametric analysis -> Applying external imperfections

3. Linear analysis seed models are unsolved models in the .mph format. These models may be used as such. If a preview of the results is desired, these models may be solved in the COMSOL desktop environment.   

4. Codes were developed and tested with these versions: COMSOL 4.2 and MATLAB R2012a. Modifications may be required in the seed models if a different version of COMSOL is used.
