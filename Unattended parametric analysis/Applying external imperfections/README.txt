1. Define parameters for external imperfection by:
(a) Defining nominal parameters in linear_analysis_seed.mph
(b) Defining multipliers to nominal parameters in the file preprocessAll.m

2. Update file names only in the script: 'setStudyNames.m'. Do not update file names in other .m files. 

3. No checks are made for "correctness" of external imperfections before performing the transformation in these codes. Physically unrealistic geometries may result if improper imperfections are used.
